       <h2>Design & Code Experience</h2>
       <p>I graduated from a design school 18 years ago, with a focus on &quot;screen-based media&quot;. The websites I built were html only &plus; some shockwave flash enhancements, perhaps a javascript pop-up window or two. <br><br>In my job search, I was very fortunate to be offered a job in a museum (did I mention my Bachelor's in Art History?), in their visual services department, I wandered away from the web. </p>
       <p>My focus has been elsewhere, but I've always kept an eye on what I'm going to do when I can get back to work. This has served me well in that I've explored a variety of vocations, like contract management, nursing, and teaching to name a few. True fulfillment came from freelance graphic design opportunities and especially from learning how to write code and build pages in the languages of the web!</p>
